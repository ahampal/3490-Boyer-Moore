COMPILATION
open terminal at the project folder and enter "make"

EXECUTION
each of the five .c files has its own main and must be executed seperately
(with the data files in the same directory) as follows:

1.1
./q1b data_4.txt

1.2
./q1P data_4.txt

2.1
./q2b data_5.txt

2.2
./q2h data_5.txt

2.3
./q2bm data_5.txt

2.4 ANALYSIS

Average shift ratio (bruteforce/horspool): 8.18
Average time ratio (bruteforce/horspool): 6.25

From the above values, we can say with certainty that bruteforce has
approximately 8 times as many shifts and takes approximately 6 times as
long.
